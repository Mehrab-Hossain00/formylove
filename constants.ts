export const ANNIVERSARY_MESSAGE = `My dearest Arshiya, these past two months have been the most beautiful chapters of my life. From the first moment our paths crossed to the quiet, mundane seconds we share now, every heartbeat feels more purposeful with you by my side. You are the grace in my day and the peace in my night. This space is a small token of my love, a sanctuary for us to celebrate the beautiful sixty days that changed my world forever. Happy 2-month anniversary, my love.`;

export const FINAL_LETTER = `My dearest Arshiya,

Looking back at that morning of October 25th, I realize now that wandering into that "Talkkkkk" channel was the single most crucial moment of my existence. I wasn't really looking for anything that day, yet I found everything. When you first texted me, I was just a normal boy in a sea of users, completely unaware that a soul as heavenly as yours was about to rewrite the trajectory of my life. I remember how quickly things moved—how we shifted from the formal "Apni" to the intimate "Tumi." It was a small change in words, but a massive shift in my world. I still smile like a fool thinking about the "Lomol" riddle; I know I won that cookie, but truth be told, having you in my life is the only prize I ever truly wanted. I remember the nerves I felt when I first called you "Pookie" and you replied with "bhai"... even though you edited it right after, my heart was racing so fast it felt like it would skip out of my chest!

But Arshiya, nothing, absolutely nothing, compares to the night of November 22nd. At 12:49 am, my world stood still. I remember fighting every fear, every insecurity, and every bit of awkwardness within me to finally send that proposal. I was almost dying of nervousness, my hands shaking so hard I could barely hold my phone. My heart was pounding like a hammer, and I honestly felt like I was losing my breath while waiting for your response. The silence of those minutes felt like an eternity. And then, against all the odds I had built up in my head, you said yesssss!

In that moment, my happiness knew no bounds. I finally got to say what I’d been holding in for so long: "I love you." And by the grace of Allah, when you replied "I love you too," I was honestly about to cry out of pure joy. I’ve never felt so seen, so valued, or so lucky. Then at 1:38 am, when you called me "babe" for the first time... I felt like I was floating. From that moment, and especially after seeing your heavenly beauty on the 23rd, my eyes and my heart have been truly blessed. Every time I look at you, I’m reminded of how lucky I am to have been chosen by a soul as pure as yours.

You are more than just my girlfriend; you are my peace, my best friend, and my greatest blessing. Even through our first argument in early January and the moments where my jealousy got the better of me, you stayed. You chose me. You let me show you my "disgusting" past habits and you accepted them—and me—without a second thought. That acceptance changed me, Arshiya. It made me realize that I don't have to be perfect for you, just real. Knowing we can be our "freaky" selves together, or that you feel comfortable enough to share your period cycles with me so I can care for you better, makes me so incredibly proud. It shows that we aren't just a couple; we are soulmates who can be completely free with one another.

I remember our first movie date, even though it was online, your presence made it more real than anything I've ever experienced. And that New Year's paragraph you wrote me? I read it over and over whenever I need to feel close to you. I promise to keep choosing you. To keep admiring your heavenly beauty, to keep trying to make you laugh, and to always be the person who listens to your stories, your fears, and your dreams. Thank you for these sixty days of pure magic, my love. I can't wait for the thousands more that are waiting for us. I will be better for you, insha allah. And one day the wait will be over and I'll finally marry you, just keep that faith in me, my dear.

I love you so much.
Forever and always,
Yours, Mehrab.`;
